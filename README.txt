Save docs that are mirrors of maps and reports created in the mapping environment.

== Description ==

When users save maps and reports in the Community Commons mapping environment,
BuddyPress Docs are created in the WordPress side of things so that all of a
user's content--collaborative docs, maps and reports--can be presented as a
single library.

In addition to maintaining those mirrors, docs that are of the type "report" or
"map" are displayed differently, showing a map when possible and rewiring the
edit functionality to occur in the mapping environment.
